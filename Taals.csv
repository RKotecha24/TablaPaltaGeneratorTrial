Pashto – पश्तो,7,3|2|2,"Pashtu is usually considered to be three vibhags of three, two, and two matras.  All three vibhags are clapped and there is no khali.  There are some who consider the structure to be wave, clap, clap; this however does not seem to be the most common view."

Kaharawā – कहरवा,8,4|4,"Kaharawa tal is one of two light-classical (or ""semi-classical"") tals which are commonly taught to classical tabla students.  Dadra tal is the other.

Dhumālī – धुमाली,8,4|4,"Dhumali tala is a tala very similar to the pakhawaj’s rendition of kaherva tala. It is used occasionally in devotional music, especially in classical kirtana. Tali: 1, Khali: 5, Jati: Catastra."
